# HIPAA Compliance Configuration Notes

## Environment Variables Required for Production

To properly deploy the HIPAA-compliant version of this app, the following environment variables should be configured:

### React Native Config (.env file)
```
# Secure API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://your-secure-api-endpoint.com

# Firebase Configuration (already configured)
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Google Auth Configuration (already configured)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
```

## HIPAA Compliance Features Implemented

### 1. Session Timeout (15 minutes)
- Automatic logout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- App backgrounding/foregrounding detection
- Activity tracking on user interactions

### 2. Access Control Validation
- Users can only access their own PHI data
- Access validation on all data fetching hooks
- Unauthorized access attempts are logged and blocked

### 3. Audit Logging
- All authentication events (login/logout/failures)
- PHI data access logging
- Session activity tracking
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Stored securely in Firestore 'audit_logs' collection

### 4. Secure Data Transmission
- HTTPS enforcement with SSL certificate validation
- Configurable secure API endpoints (replace localhost URLs)
- Request security headers and timeouts
- Rejection of invalid SSL certificates

## Security Notes

- All audit logs are stored in Firestore with timestamp, user ID, and activity details
- Session timeout hook integrates with existing Firebase authentication
- Access control validates user identity before any PHI data access
- Secure API endpoints should be configured via environment variables for production deployment

## Testing

To test the HIPAA compliance features:
1. Login and wait 15 minutes to test session timeout
2. Try accessing another user's data to test access control
3. Check Firestore 'audit_logs' collection for logged events
4. Test app backgrounding/foregrounding timeout behavior
